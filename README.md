Example using AngularJS (some Knockout), WebAPI 2, EF 6

The Tutorial this originates from is at http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/creating-web-apis/using-web-api-with-entity-framework/part-1

It is primary for WebAPI2 and EF6, but included the Knockout - in which you can see in this project.  I added the AngularJS section.
